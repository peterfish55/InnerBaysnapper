Inner Gulf Assessment models

The necessary steps are:
1. Pull down the files to c:/github
2. Copy the files to your directory of choice
     The first 3 files are to get the calculation stared for the calculation of the effective 
     sample size scalor (phi) using the method of McAlaster and Ianelli. The first two of the 
     three files are updated during the iterative process
        value_of_phi.dat
        pred_prop_age_composition.dat
        prop_age_composition.dat
     The following two files are just to reset the values in the files above for a new run.
        first_value_of_phi.dat
        first_pred_prop_age_composition.dat 
3. The "R" code determines the data for the model run. You must select a fishery here. At the top of the "R" code
   you must also select whether you want the output to go to a .tif file.
4. The "R" code then extracts the data for the fishery from the three .csv files for age, biomass, and catch
   and writes them to the ADMB files .dat and .pin 
5. Half way through the code, a .bat file is run which runs the model 7 times to calculate iterativerly phi and
   save the run outputs (parameter values and gradienTS to a file output.dat  You need to check this and make sure 
   the model converged.
6. The last half of the code plots the outputs.
